# üìë PDF ToC Editor

A simple desktop application for editing the **Table of Contents (ToC)** in PDF files.  
Built with [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) for the GUI and [PyMuPDF](https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/) for PDF handling.

## ‚ú® Features
- Open any PDF and view its existing ToC.
- **Edit ToC**: add, rename, delete, move, or nest entries.
- **Drag & drop reordering** of ToC entries.
- **Import/Export ToC** in JSON format.
- Save the modified ToC **directly into the PDF**.
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for quick actions
- **View the opened PDF** in your default PDF viewer

### # Example ToC Export (JSON)
   ```json
    [
       [1, "Chapter 1", 1],
       [1, "Chapter 2", 5],
       [2, "Section 2.1", 6],
       [2, "Section 2.2", 10],
       [1, "Chapter 3", 15]
    ]
   ```

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts
| Keystroke          | Action                 |
|--------------------|------------------------|
| `Ctrl + O`         | Open PDF               |
| `Ctrl + N`         | Add Sibling Entry      |
| `Ctrl + Shift + N` | Add Child Entry        |
| `Ctrl + T`         | Edit Selected Title    |
| `Ctrl + E`         | Edit Selected Page No. |
| `Ctrl + A`         | Select all             |
| `Ctrl + ‚Üë / ‚Üì`     | Move item(s) up/down   |
| `Delete`           | Delete selected        |
| `Ctrl + Z / Y`     | Undo/Redo              |
| `Ctrl + S`         | Save to PDF            |
| `Ctrl + Shift + S` | Save As...             |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
- Uses **PyMuPDF (`fitz`)** to parse and modify PDF ToC entries.
- ToC is represented hierarchically in a **tree view widget** (editable by double-click).
- Supports both **single page references** and **page ranges** (e.g., `5-10`).
- Saves changes **incrementally** (`saveIncr`) to avoid rewriting the whole file.
